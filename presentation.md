# Integrating Manual & Automatic Image Annotations

## Chris Barnes, Cardona lab

---

# The Lab

<!-- Take a terabyte-scale stack of EM images -->
(1) Raw EM stack

<!--Manually trace neurites - labour-intensive!-->
<!--Annotate synapses between cells to build towards a connectome-->
(2) Morphology/ connectivity

<!--Analyse those connections to infer meaningful circuits-->
(3) Circuitry

<!--Integrate this information with genetically-derived cell identity, behavioural and functional data-->
(4) ???

<!--How this little chunk of the nervous system does what it does-->
(5) PAPERS
